  "transcription": " What do you love? I love to go on long hikes in nature, especially with people who like to have a good time and who can make jokes. That sounds really wonderful. What would you love to gain out of this AGI House event? I hope to meet people who have similar career interests as me, who maybe in the future I can found a company with and who I can build long-term relationships with, working relationships. What is your background that you would bring to that company? Yeah, so I've worked in pathology AI for about three to four years now, so I've got a lot of expertise on how to bring AI to medical domains, what clinicians are looking for, and how to best approach AI deployment in kind of sensitive areas. Wonderful. Perfect. Okay."

  "transcription": " I'm gonna record this and send it to our back office. What's the question again? What do you love? What do I love? I love learning and I love building things in my free time. And I love the beach and surfing and the outdoors. Wow, amazing, amazing. What is your expectation? What do you want to gain from today the most? From today's hackathon, I wanted to gain more experience building agents with a bunch of these frameworks and tools that we have out here. And just learn, become a better engineer in general. Okay, great. Thank you so much."

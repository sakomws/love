  "transcription": " Please, can you share with us what do you love? I guess science fiction and development technologies. Wow, great. And what would you like to gain from this event? Learning about what's going on in kind of this space and, you know, the neat things people are developing. Okay. Is there any specifics to that that you may like to add? I would say probably not. I would say it is a very general interest. Yeah. OK. Great. Hopefully that doesn't flummox you. No, it's just a very specific thing."

  "transcription": " Sir, what's your name? My name is Huy. Mr. Huy, what do you love? What I love? I love to do new stuff, great things, like new stuff that is helpful and cool. Okay, great. What would you like to gain the most from this event? For today, I think that I want to see, I just want to know how the hackathons in the Bay Area usually look like. And this is like my first time here at this event in the Bay Area to be at a hackathon. So I just want to see how people connect, how people work together and how it is usually organized. And I really like it. I'm definitely going to be back next time. So that's the first thing. The second thing is just like learning more about agentic AI. I have learned about this for some time but never have a chance to really read into it. So today I just spend it basically just to read a bunch of materials about it. Okay, okay. Wow, thank you so much."

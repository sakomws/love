I'm also a realtor in San Francisco Bay Area and also like the whole California. Amazing. And the second question, what would you like to gain the most from this event? I would like to connect with more like-minded people and then expand my connections. And then I also like to join AGI events often, so there's a very good quality of startups here. Okay, great."
